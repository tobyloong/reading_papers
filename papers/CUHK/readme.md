There was a serious deviation from the average score in my grades, with a 69 for the Database course in 2024 spring semester.

This happened during an extremely busy semester for me, where I was concurrently taking eight computer science courses. Additionally, I was heavily involved in a programming competition and a project with Microsoft, consuming a significant portion of my time. 

Unfortunately, due to the sudden inclusion of the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) on the U.S. Commerce Department's Entity List in May this year, not only was our joint project with Microsoft abruptly canceled, but there were also potential implications for my future applications. Consequently, I had to embark on finding alternative options, such as exploring opportunities in mainland China and Hong Kong, which took up considerable time for research, school applications, interviews, and discussions with my family that often led to disagreements.

During that period, I genuinely felt overwhelmed and under immense pressure, making it impossible to excel in every aspect. As a result, I devoted relatively less attention to the Database course, missing two straightforward quizzes and submitting the final lab assignment late, resulting in a deduction of 19 points from my usual performance grade.

The instructor for this course placed particular emphasis on regular assessments, with the final exam only accounting for 40% of the total grade, which was unexpected for me.

My knowledge in the subject matter remains solid, as evidenced by my satisfactory performance in the final exam. For perspective, a classmate who achieved the same score as me in the final but had better usual performance received an overall grade of 88.

Excluding this course, my GPA for the rest of my courses stands at 3.83, which I believe offers a more accurate reflection of my academic achievements.
